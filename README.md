# Markdown Viewer

A simple, single-page web application designed to render Markdown files (`input.md`) directly into HTML using `marked.js` and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

*   **Markdown to HTML Conversion**: Automatically fetches `input.md` and converts its content into well-formatted HTML.
*   **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, responsive user experience.
*   **Single-File Application**: All necessary HTML, CSS (Tailwind CDN), and JavaScript (Marked.js CDN) are contained within `index.html`.

## Getting Started

To run this application, simply:

1.  Save the `index.html` file, `input.md`, and `LICENSE` in the same directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

The application will automatically fetch and display the content of `input.md`.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main single-page application.
*   `input.md`: The Markdown file to be rendered (must be present in the same directory).
*   `LICENSE`: The MIT License for the project.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
*   **Tailwind CSS (CDN)**: For utility-first styling and responsive design.
*   **Marked.js (CDN)**: A high-performance Markdown parser and compiler.
